# Leaf-identification-Machine-Learning-Project
Before the development of machine learning techniques, leaf identification has
always been done by experts of this specific field, capable of deciding the species
of a given leaf on the grounds of their knowledge. Nowadays, they can be
supported in this task by automatic leaf recognition systems, which provide
extremely useful tools also for non-professionals. The aim of this project is
to find the best among some classifiers which, given some features related to
the shape and the texture of a leaf displayed in an image, are able to return
the name of the species of the leaf. Hence, the idea is to compare different
models according to some performance indexes and decide which one suits the
leaf identification problem best.
